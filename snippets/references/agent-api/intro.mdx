The Miru Agent API is a REST API for programmatically interacting with the Miru Agent from an application running on your device.

The Agent API is not available over the internet and is only accessible from the device running the Miru Agent. It is useful for manually refreshing configurations, retrieving current configurations, and checking agent status directly from applications running on the device.

The Agent API is distinct from the [Server-Side API](/docs/references/server-side-api/2025-08-01/intro), which is a REST API for backend services and CI/CD pipelines to manage Miru resources.
