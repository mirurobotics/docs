Miru's Server-Side API is a REST API for programmatically managing your Miru resources.  The Server-Side API is primarily for backend and cloud-native applications, enabling you to build custom workflows for device provisioning, CI/CD pipelines, and more.

The Server-Side API is distinct from the Agent API, which is a REST API exposed by the Miru Agent for programmatic control by applications _running on your devices_.

While the Server-Side API is accessed over the internet, the [Agent API](/docs/references/agent-api/v0.2.0/intro) is available only on devices running the Miru Agent and does not require internet access to operate.
