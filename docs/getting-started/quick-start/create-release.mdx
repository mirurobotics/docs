To keep things simple, we've provided a [getting-started repository](https://github.com/mirurobotics/getting-started) that contains everything you need to create a release. Follow along with us by cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mirurobotics/getting-started.git
```

## Define the schemas

Releases are primarily defined by the config schemas they contain. The getting-started repository contains two sets of schemas for each of the supported [schema languages](/docs/learn/schemas/languages/overview):

- Empty schemas - regard all config instances as valid
- Strict schemas - constrain the valid fields, types, and values for instances of the config type they belong to

For this tutorial, choose one of these schema sets to create your release with.

If you're unfamiliar with schema languages, we recommend starting with [JSON Schema](/docs/learn/schemas/languages/jsonschema). If you don't currently use a schema, we recommend starting with an empty schema and gradually adding constraints as needed.

## Create the config types

To be able to push the schemas to Miru, we must first create config types to house them. We'll start with the `Mobility` config type.

Navigate to the [config types page](https://app.mirurobotics.com/configs).

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.mirurobotics.com/docs/v03/images/config-types/create-page.png)
</Frame>

Click the **New Config Type** button, supply the name `Mobility` and slug `mobility`, and click **Create**.

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.mirurobotics.com/docs/v03/images/config-types/create-dialog.png)
</Frame>

The provided slug is a unique identifier for the config type--it's how the CLI determines which config type a schema belongs to. As such, config schemas _must_ be annotated with the slug of the config type to which they belong.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml JSON Schema
x-miru-config-type: "mobility"
```


```cue CUE
@miru(config_type="mobility")
```

</CodeGroup>

The getting-started repository already annotates the schemas with the appropriate slugs, so no need to add them yourself.

After creating the `Mobility` config type, **repeat this process** for the `Communication` and `Planning` config types, using the slugs `communication` and `planning` respectively.


## Set up the CLI

Next, we'll install the CLI—the primary method of creating releases in Miru.

Creating releases via the CLI is a deliberate design choice. We believe a release's schemas should live in a Git repository. This allows them to be versioned alongside the code that uses them and encourages better software development practices.

While this tutorial covers creating releases on your local machine, the CLI can also be used to create releases in a [CI pipeline](/docs/developers/ci/overview).

## Create a release

With the CLI setup, we are ready to create a release in Miru.

Navigate to the root of the [getting-started](https://github.com/mirurobotics/getting-started) repository and create the release with a schema set of your choice.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JSON Schema">
    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Empty Schemas
    miru release create \
      --version "v1.0.0" \
      --schemas ./jsonschema/empty-schemas/
    ```

    
    ```bash Strict Schemas
    miru release create \
      --version "v1.0.0" \
      --schemas ./jsonschema/strict-schemas/
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CUE">
    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Empty Schemas
    miru release create \
      --version "v1.0.0" \
      --schemas ./cue/empty-schemas/
    ```

    
    ```bash Strict Schemas
    miru release create \
      --version "v1.0.0" \
      --schemas ./cue/strict-schemas/
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Upon a successful creation, you'll see a confirmation message similar to the following:

```bash
$ miru release create \
  --version v1.0.0 \
  --schemas ./{schema-language}/{schema-type}/

◐ Creating release v1.0.0

  ✓ Pushed git commit (new)
    1c7f7a8 · miruml/getting-started

  ◐ Pushing schemas
    ✓ Mobility · SCH-D5nFP (new)
    ✓ Planning · SCH-37QAr (new)
    ✓ Communication · SCH-9WfCx (new)

✓ Created release v1.0.0
```

<Info>
  Git metadata is pulled from the local Git repository that the schemas are defined in.

To view the release in Miru, navigate to the [releases page](https://app.mirurobotics.com/releases) and click into the release.
