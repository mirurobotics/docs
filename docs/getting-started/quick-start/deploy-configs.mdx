title: "Deploy configs"

We're ready to deploy config instances to a device.

Navigate back to the [Devices page](https://app.mirurobotics.com/devices) and click into the device we activated in the previous step.

Select the release we just created and hit **Next**.

Input the desired parameters for the `Mobility`, `Planning`, and `Communication` config instances respectively.

<Note>
  The instances are auto-populated with the default values defined in the release's config schemas. If using empty schemas, the auto-populated instances will be empty as well.
</Note>

Finally, provide a description for the deployment, then click **Deploy**.

## Verify the deployment

To verify a config seen in the editor is deployed to the device, drop down the deployed config instance (the one with the green dot) in the editor.

</Frame>

The `File Path` field shows the file system path that the config instance is deployed to, relative to `/srv/miru/config_instances`.

Since the `File Path` is `/mobility.json`, the config instance is deployed to `/srv/miru/config_instances/mobility.json`.

To verify the config instance is deployed to the device's file system, open a terminal on the device and navigate to the `/srv/miru/config_instances` directory.

```bash
cd /srv/miru/config_instances
```

Then `cat` the config instance by copying the `File Path` displayed in the editor.

```bash
cat mobility.json
```

You should find that the editor's content is identical to the config instance on the device.

## Patch a config instance

To edit a config instance, make some changes to the current config instance. As edits are made, a log on the right maintains a list of all changes, categorizing them by their type: `added`, `deleted`, or `modified`.

</Frame>

<Warning>
  Only the latest config instance for a config type may be edited. All other config instances are read-only.
</Warning>

Once you are satisfied with the edits, click **Deploy** in the top right.

A dialog will appear to confirm the deployment. Add a description, confirm the device, and click **Deploy**.
