Releases are located in the [Releases page](https://app.mirurobotics.com/releases) of the dashboard.

## View a release

**Dashboard**

To view a release and its schemas, click into the release from the releases page and switch to the **Overview** tab at the top.

**Platform API**

To retrieve a release programmatically, use the [get release endpoint »](/docs/references/platform-api/latest/endpoints/releases/get)

## Duplicate a release

Duplicating a release creates a new release with the same config schemas and git information as the original. 

Of course, since releases require a unique version, the duplicated release must have a *different version* from the original release.

Duplicating a release does not duplicate the release's deployments—only the release, its schemas, and git information are duplicated.

To duplicate a release, click the ellipses (...) on the release you want to duplicate and select **Duplicate**.

A dialog will appear—input the new version name and hit **Create**.

## Delete a release

Deleting a release is only possible if no deployments have been delivered to any device with that release. Otherwise, the release cannot be deleted.

To delete a release, click the ellipses (...) on the release you want to delete and hit **Delete**.

A confirmation dialog will appear. Hit **Delete** to confirm the deletion.
