Devices are located in the [Devices page](https://app.mirurobotics.com/devices) of the dashboard.

</Frame>

**Platform API**

To edit a device programmatically, use the [update device endpoint »](/docs/references/platform-api/latest/endpoints/devices/update)

## Ping a device

Pinging a device sends a real-time request to verify whether it is online. Ping requests wait up to 5 seconds for a response from the device before timing out.

<Tooltip tip={ONLINE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ONLINE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ONLINE_TOOLTIP.href}>Online</Tooltip> devices should return a success message similar to the one below.

On the other hand, <Tooltip tip={OFFLINE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={OFFLINE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={OFFLINE_TOOLTIP.href}>offline</Tooltip> devices should return a timeout message similar to the one below.

## Reactivate a device

Reactivating a device is the process of reinstalling the Miru Agent on a device that was previously activated. Reactivating a device:

1. Invalidates the device's current authentication session
2. Creates a new authentication session for the device
3. Resets the Miru Agent to a clean state
4. Recreates the device's current deployments

Reactivating a device resets the Miru Agent to a clean state while preserving the device's full deployment history.

**Dashboard**

To reactivate a device, click the ellipsis (...) next to the device you want to reactivate, then select **Reactivate**.

</Frame>

A dialog will appear with a pre-authenticated reactivation command. Copy this command and paste it into a terminal of the device you want to reactivate.

</Frame>

Outside the reactivation capability, this installation command is identical to the activation command used to provision a device. For more information on the installation command, visit the [dashboard device provisioning](/docs/learn/devices/provision#install-the-agent) documentation.

**Platform API**

To reactivate a device programmatically, use the [API key provisioning](/docs/learn/devices/provision#api-keys) workflow with the [`--allow-reactivation`](/docs/learn/devices/provision#param-allow-reactivation) flag enabled.

## Delete a device

Deleting a device immediately invalidates its authentication session and removes all deployment and configuration history. This action is irreversible. Please proceed with caution.

**Dashboard**

To delete a device, click the ellipses (...) on the device you want to delete and hit **Delete**.

A confirmation dialog will appear--click **Delete** to confirm.
