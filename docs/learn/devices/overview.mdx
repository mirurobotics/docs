## Properties

<ParamField path="name" type="string">
  <EditableBadge />

  A human-readable display name that can contain most characters, such as spaces, special characters, and punctuation. Must contain between 1 and 48 characters.

  Examples: `Robot 11`, `ArcticBlaze`, `Scooby Doo`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="status" type="enum">
  <MutableBadge />

  The [status](#status) of the device.

  Allowed values: 
  - `inactive`
  - `activating`
  - `online`
  - `offline`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="agent version" type="string">
  <MutableBadge />

  {' '}

  <NullableBadge />

  The version of the Miru Agent running on the device.

  The agent version exists only if the device has a status of `online` or `offline`. If the device is `inactive` or `activating`, the agent version is `null`.

  Examples: `v0.6.0`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="current release" type="Release">
  <EditableBadge />

  {' '}

  <NullableBadge />

  The [release](/docs/learn/releases/overview#properties) to which the device's current deployment belongs.

  If the device is `inactive` or `activating`, the current release id is `null`. If the device is `online` or `offline`, the current release may still be `null` if the device has no deployed config instances.

  Examples: `rls_123`
</ParamField>

## Miru Agent

Configurations are deployed to devices via the [Miru Agent](/docs/developers/agent/intro), a lightweight `systemd` service that runs on your devices, handling the deployment lifecycle of configurations.

The Miru Agent offers the following functionality:

- **Syncs configurations** from the cloud to the local filesystem in real-time
- **Manages device state**, providing real-time updates of the device's status and the currently deployed configurations
- [**Exposes a REST API**](/docs/developers/agent-api/overview) over a Unix socket for programmatic access by applications running on the same machine

<Note>
  The Miru Agent only supports Linux. Visit the [supported platforms](/docs/developers/agent/intro#supported-platforms) for a complete list of supported platforms.
</Note>

Read more about the agent in the [Miru Agent](/docs/developers/agent/intro) section.

## Status

Devices leverage several states to track their registration and connectivity with the Miru servers.

| Status       | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inactive`   | The Miru Agent has not yet been installed and authenticated |
| `activating` | The Miru Agent is registering itself with Miru's servers    |
| `online`     | Device is currently connected to Miru's servers             |
| `offline`    | Device has lost connection to Miru's servers                |

Devices begin in the `inactive` state. During the Miru Agent install process, devices briefly enter the `activating` state before transitioning to `online`.

Once the Miru Agent has been activated on a device, the device remains `online` or `offline` for the remainder of its existence--devices don't transition back to `inactive` or `activating`.

The only exception to this is when a device is [reactivated](/docs/learn/devices/manage#reactivate-a-device). During reactivation, devices briefly enter the `activating` state before transitioning back to `online`.

To view a device's status, hover over its name on the [Devices page](/docs/learn/devices/overview#devices-page).
