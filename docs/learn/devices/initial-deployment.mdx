title: "Initial deployment"
---

This guide walks through making your first deployment to a new device — from
selecting the device on the Devices page to deploying its initial configuration.

## Select a device

To create a device's initial deployment, navigate to the
[Devices page](https://app.mirurobotics.com/devices).

</Frame>

Only devices that been [provisioned](/docs/learn/devices/provision), but never
deployed to, are candidates for an initial deployment.

You can identify these devices by their **Release** column. If their release
column displays a placeholder button of **Set** instead of a release version
(i.e. `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.), then the device is a candidate for an initial
deployment. Continue by clicking into the device you want to initialize. 

## Set the release

Since the device doesn't have a current release, a dialog will appear prompting you
to select a release. The selected release will be used to create the device's 
initial deployment.

<Note>
  If no releases are shown, you will need to
  [create a release](/docs/learn/releases/create) before
  continuing.
</Note>

## Edit configs

Once the release is set, the editor opens in **draft mode**. Since this is the 
first deployment, it automatically fills with default values from your release's 
config schemas.

<Info>
For a detailed overview of the editor interface see the 
[config editor](/docs/learn/devices/config-editor) page.

## Deploy

Once you are satisfied with the configuration, click the **Deploy** button in
the controls panel header to open the deploy dialog.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review changes">
    The deploy dialog opens with a summary of all changes. For a
    first deployment, every file is listed as added.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a description">
    Enter a description for this deployment (e.g., "init deployment").
    This field is required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the device name">
    Type the device name exactly as shown to confirm.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click **Deploy** to queue the configurations for deployment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After a successful deployment, the editor switches to the **History** tab and
displays the new deployment. The deployment status will turn green, indicating that the
device has received the configurations.
