The config editor is the primary way to view and edit a device's configuration files.

Open the editor by clicking into a device from the
[Devices page](https://app.mirurobotics.com/devices) and selecting the **Editor**
tab at the top.

## Layout

The editor is split into two resizable panels:

- **Editor panel** — A code editor for editing configuration files or viewing
  historical versions.
- **Controls panel** — Controls what the editor displays and provides actions
  like deploying changes or browsing deployment history.

### Editor panel

#### Tabs

Tabs appear across the top of the editor and list every configuration file
available for editing (in draft mode) or viewing (in history mode).

    </Tab>
</Tabs>

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **M** (yellow) | The file has been modified (draft). |
| **A** (green) | The file was added (draft). |
| **Error count** (red) | The file contains JSON syntax errors (draft). |
| **Lock icon** | The file is read-only (history). |
| **Deployment ID** | Displays the ID of the [head](#base-vs-head) deployment (history). |

#### Toolbar

The toolbar sits between the tabs and the code editor. Its contents change
depending on the current mode:

- **Draft mode** — Displays a **JSON breadcrumb** showing the file name and the
  JSON path at the cursor position. Each segment is labeled with its type
  (object, array, string, number, boolean, or null).
- **History mode** — Displays the **diff selector**, which lets you choose which
  two deployments to compare (see [Base vs. Head](#base-vs-head)).

The toolbar always includes:

- **Search** — Press <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + F</kbd> to open a search popover. Type to
  find matches in the current file. Use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to go to the next
  match, <kbd>Shift + Enter</kbd> for the previous match, and <kbd>Escape</kbd>
  to close. The popover shows your current position (e.g., "1 of 5").
- **File actions** — A menu with options to copy the file contents to your
  clipboard or download the file as JSON.

</Tabs>

#### Footer

The footer displays the file type ("JSON") and the current cursor position
(line and column).

### Controls panel

The controls panel has a header with two tabs — **Draft** and **History** — that
determine both the panel's content and the editor's mode.

<Frame>

</Frame>

#### Draft tab

Selecting the **Draft** tab puts the editor in edit mode. The panel shows the
**Deploy** button in the header and the [change list](#change-list) in the body.

- **Deploy button** — Appears next to the tabs when the draft tab is active and
  a draft exists. Clicking it opens the [deploy dialog](#deploying-changes).
  The button is disabled when the device is offline, there are no changes, or
  any file has JSON syntax errors. Hover over the disabled button to see the
  reason.
- **Change list** — A file-by-file summary of every modification in the current
  draft (see [Change list](#change-list)).

#### History tab

Selecting the **History** tab switches the editor to read-only mode. The panel
shows the [deployment list](#deployment-list) in the body.

- **Deployment list** — All past deployments grouped by release version, with
  the most recent at the top (see [Deployment list](#deployment-list)).
- **Load more** — If more deployments are available, a **Load more** button
  appears at the bottom of the list to fetch the next page.

<Info>
The History tab is disabled if the device has no deployments yet.
Hovering over it shows a "No deployments" tooltip.
</Info>

## Draft

When the **Draft** tab is selected in the controls panel, the editor enters
edit mode. You can modify any configuration file directly in the editor.
Changes are tracked locally until you deploy them.

A draft is automatically created when you open the editor. If the device has
existing deployments, the draft is based on the most recent one. If this is a
new device with no deployments, the draft is initialized from the release's
default configuration.

### Change list

The controls panel shows a **change list** that summarizes every modification in
the current draft. Changes are grouped by file, with each file section showing
its name and a change count (e.g., "3 changes") or "New file" for newly added
files. Within each section, individual changes are listed with:

- The **type** of change — added, modified, or deleted — color-coded green,
  yellow, or red respectively.
- The **JSON path** of the affected value (e.g., `settings > network > ip`).
  Long paths are truncated; hover to see the full path.

Files with no changes show a "No changes" label.

    <Step title="Add a description">
        Enter a description for the deployment. This field is required.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Confirm the device name">
        Type the device name exactly as shown to confirm the deployment.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy">
        Click **Deploy** to push the changes. After a successful deployment, the
        editor automatically switches to the History tab and selects the new
        deployment.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
    The Deploy button is disabled when:
    - The device is offline.
    - The draft has no changes.
    - Any file contains JSON syntax errors.

    Hover over the disabled button to see the reason.

## History

When the **History** tab is selected, the editor switches to read-only mode and
displays past deployments.

### Deployment list

The controls panel shows all deployments grouped by release version. Within
each group, deployments are listed from most recent to oldest with each entry showing:

- Description
- Deployment status and ID
- Who created it and when

Click a deployment to view it's contents. The selected deployment is called the
**head** deployment, and its configuration files are loaded into the editor.
The head deployment is highlighted with a solid left border and a subtle
background. When a base deployment is selected for diffing, it is indicated with
a dashed left border.

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.mirurobotics.com/docs/v03/images/devices/editor/history-list.png)
</Frame>

**Right-click** a deployment to open a context menu with options to:

- **Redeploy** — Restore an archived deployment (see [Redeploy](#redeploy)).
- **Set as diff base** — Use this deployment as the comparison baseline.
- **Copy ID** or **Copy description**.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Diff and read-only modes

In the History tab, the editor supports two view modes:

- **Read-only** — Displays the head deployment's files without any diff
  highlighting.
- **Diff** — Highlights the differences between the head and base deployments
  using color-coded decorations:
  - **Green** — Added lines.
  - **Yellow** — Modified lines, showing the old and new values.
  - **Red** — Deleted lines, showing the removed content.
    content.

</Frame>

### Diff navigation

When viewing a diff, navigation controls appear as a floating overlay above the
footer:

- **Change navigation** — Step through individual changes within the current
  file using the previous/next buttons. A position label (e.g., "1 of 3")
  tracks your place. Open the changes dropdown to see all changes listed by
  type and JSON path, and jump to any one directly.
- **File navigation** — When multiple files contain changes, use the file
  navigation controls to jump between them. A label (e.g., "1 of 3 files")
  shows your position.

The currently focused change is highlighted with a flash animation.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Base vs. Head

The diff view compares two deployments:

- **Base** — The older deployment used as the comparison starting point.
  Defaults to the deployment immediately before the head. You can change it
  using the diff selector in the toolbar or by right-clicking a deployment and
  selecting "Set as diff base." Only deployments older than the head are
  available as a base.
- **Head** — The currently selected deployment. Shown as a read-only label in
  the diff selector.

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.mirurobotics.com/docs/v03/images/devices/editor/base-head.png)
</Frame>

### Redeploy

You can redeploy the configurations from any archived deployment. Right-click the
deployment in the history list and select **Redeploy** to open the redeploy
dialog.

The redeploy dialog shows:

- A card with the original deployment's details (description, status, ID,
  creator, and date).
- A description field (pre-filled with a reference to the original deployment).

## External deployment sync

If another user (or system) deploys to the same device while you have the editor
open, an alert appears with the new deployment's details. The alert offers different 
options depending on whether you have unsaved edits:

**No edits in progress:**
- **Acknowledge** — Accepts the external deployment and resets your draft to
  match it.

**Edits in progress:**
- **Discard** — Discards your edits and resets the draft to the external
  deployment.
- **Keep** — Merges your edits on top of the external deployment using a
  three-way JSON merge, preserving your changes where possible.
