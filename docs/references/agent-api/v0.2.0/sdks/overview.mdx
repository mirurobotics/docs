Miru provides SDKs to simplify interaction with the API exposed by the Miru Agent locally on your machine.

These SDKs handle the complexities of Unix socket communication and provide type-safe interfaces for all available endpoints.

## Languages

### Python

<PythonIntro />

### Coming soon

#### C++
A C++ SDK is also planned, featuring:
- Modern C++17/20 support
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Minimal dependencies
- High-performance async operations

#### Rust
A Rust SDK is coming soon and will provide:
- Zero-cost abstractions for maximum performance
- Memory-safe Unix socket communication
- Full async/await support with `tokio`
- Comprehensive type safety with `serde`


## Need help?

If you're using a language not yet supported by an official SDK, you can still interact with the Agent API directly using HTTP requests over the Unix socket at `/run/miru/miru.sock`. See the [Endpoints](/docs/references/agent-api/v0.2.0/endpoints/agent/health) page for information about the available endpoints.
