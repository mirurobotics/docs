Miru provides SDKs to simplify interaction with the Server-Side API.

These SDKs handle the complexities of HTTP communication and API key authentication and provide type-safe interfaces for all available endpoints.

## Languages

### Python

## Direct API usage

If you're using a language not yet supported by an official SDK, you can still interact with the Agent API directly using HTTP requests over the Unix socket at `/run/miru/miru.sock`. See the [Endpoints](/docs/references/agent-api/endpoints/agent/health) page for information about the available endpoints.
