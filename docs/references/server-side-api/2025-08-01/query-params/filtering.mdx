title: "Filtering"
---

All list endpoints in the Miru API support filtering to help you retrieve specific resources.

For example, when [listing devices](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/devices/list), you can filter by `id`, `name`, and other fields.

## Single value filters

Each list endpoint supports its own set of filter names. To see the filters supported by a specific endpoint, look for query parameters in the **Query Parameters** section containing _filter by_ in their description.

`id` is a common filter amongst all list endpoints. It allows you to filter by a resource’s unique identifier. For example, when listing devices, you can filter by the [**device id**](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/devices/list#parameter-id) using **`id=<device-id>`** in the request URL.

The following uses the `id=dvc_123` filter to include only the device with the `dvc_123` `id`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.mirurobotics.com/v1/devices?id=dvc_123' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

Filtering by ID will return at most one resource, since IDs are unique. Other fields, like [config instance activity status](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/config-instances/list#parameter-activity-status), can return multiple results.

## Multi-value filters

To filter by multiple values, specify the filter values as a `|` separated list: `<filter_name>=<value_1>|<value_2>|<value_3>`.

Thus, to filter devices by multiple ids, you can use the `id` filter with a `|` separated list of ids: `id=dvc_123|dvc_456|dvc_789`.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.mirurobotics.com/v1/devices?id=dvc_123|dvc_456|dvc_789' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

## Combining filters

You can combine filters using `&`. All filters are combined with AND logic, so resources must match all criteria.

The following request filters the device list to include only the devices with the IDs `dvc_123` and `dvc_456` and the name `Robot A`: `id=dvc_123|dvc_456&name=Robot%20A`.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.mirurobotics.com/v1/devices?id=dvc_123|dvc_456&name=Robot%20A' \ 
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

## URL encoding

When using filters with special characters, ensure that you properly URL-encode the values.

For example, spaces are URL encoded as `%20`. Browsers and client applications will automatically URL-encode the values for you, so you shouldn't need to worry about it, but it's good to know.

The following request filters the device list to only include devices named `My Device Name` using the `name=My%20Device%20Name` filter.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.mirurobotics.com/v1/devices?name=My%20Device%20Name' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```
