To install the Miru Agent, please visit the [device provisioning](/docs/learn/devices/provision) section, which provides detailed instructions for installing and activating the agent via the following methods:

- [Dashboard](/docs/learn/devices/provision#dashboard) - a simple web interface for installing the agent on individual devices
- [API Keys](/docs/learn/devices/provision#api-keys) - a programmatic way to install the agent on many devices
- [Poor Connectivity](/docs/learn/devices/provision#poor-connectivity) - a method for installing the agent on devices with poor connectivity

## Upgrade

To upgrade the Miru Agent to a new version, rerun the provisioning process with the `--allow-reactivation` and `--version` flags. This installs the specified agent version and reactivates the device, refreshing its authentication credentials in the process.

**API Keys**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mirurobotics/agent/main/scripts/install/provision.sh | sh -s -- \
  --device-name=$HOSTNAME \
  --allow-reactivation=true \
  --version=<desired-version>
```

Replace `<desired-version>` with the version you want to install (e.g., `v0.7.0`). See all [available versions](https://github.com/mirurobotics/agent/releases).

**Dashboard**

To upgrade a device provisioned through the dashboard, copy a fresh installation command from the device's page in the dashboard and run it on the device. The installation script automatically handles reactivation.

The device retains its identity and deployment state across upgrades — only the agent binary and authentication credentials are refreshed. Existing deployed configurations remain on the filesystem and are not interrupted.
