The Miru Agent follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for its releases. 

Currently, the Miru Agent is still in beta, signified by the `v0` prefix for its releases. There is no established release cadence for the Miru Agent--features are simply released as soon as they are ready.

**CLI**

To check the agent version from the command line, run the following command on the device the agent is running on:

```bash
miru-agent --version
```

**Platform API**

To check the agent version from the Platform API, query the <LinkNewTab href="/docs/references/platform-api/latest/endpoints/devices/list#query-parameters">list devices</LinkNewTab> endpoint and <LinkNewTab href="/docs/developers/platform-api/query-params/filtering">filter</LinkNewTab> by the `agent_version` field.

## Support policy

Miru provides three levels of support for the Miru Agent

- Supported
- Deprecated
- End of life

### Supported

Supported agent versions are actively maintained. They receive bug fixes, security patches, and new features. These versions are recommended for all deployments.

### Deprecated

When a new agent version is released, previous versions may enter a deprecation period. During this period:

- The deprecated agent continues to function normally
- No new features or non-critical bug fixes will be backported
- Security patches may still be applied at Miru's discretion

### End of life

After the deprecation period, an agent version reaches **end-of-life**. End-of-life agents may lose server compatibility and should not be used. For example, the Miru backend may stop supporting the protocol version they use, causing syncs to fail.

### Deprecation notice

Since the Miru Agent is still in beta, a fixed support schedule for beta releases is not established. 

Nonetheless, we are committed to ensuring that all users are migrated to a supported version before sunsetting an agent version. Reasonable notice will be provided before deprecating and sunsetting any agent versions.
