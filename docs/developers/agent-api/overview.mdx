The Miru Agent API is a REST API for programmatically interacting with the Miru Agent from an application running on the same device as the agent.

The Agent API is not available over the internet--it is only accessible from the device running the Miru Agent. It is useful for manually refreshing configurations, retrieving current configurations, and checking agent status from applications running on your devices.

The Agent API is distinct from the Miru [Platform API](/docs/developers/platform-api/overview), which is a REST API for backend services and CI/CD pipelines to manage Miru resources.

To get started, continue to the [Authentication](/docs/developers/agent-api/authn) page to learn how requests are authenticated. For a complete reference of all available API endpoints, visit the Agent API Reference.
