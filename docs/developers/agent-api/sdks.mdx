Miru provides SDKs to simplify interaction with the API exposed by the Miru Agent locally on your machine.

These SDKs handle the complexities of Unix socket communication and provide type-safe interfaces for all available endpoints.

## Python

The Python [Agent SDK](https://github.com/mirurobotics/python-agent-sdk) provides convenient access to the Agent API from any Python 3.8+ application. The SDK offers the following features:

- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and Pydantic models
- **Async Support**: Both synchronous and asynchronous clients
- **Automatic Retries**: Built-in retry logic for transient failures
- **Unix Socket**: Native support for local Unix socket communication

For detailed documentation, examples, and advanced usage, visit the Python Agent SDK repository.

## Coming soon

### C++
A C++ SDK is also planned, featuring:
- Modern C++17/20 support
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Minimal dependencies
- High-performance async operations

### Rust
A Rust SDK is coming soon and will provide:
- Zero-cost abstractions for maximum performance
- Memory-safe Unix socket communication
- Full async/await support with `tokio`
- Comprehensive type safety with `serde`

## Direct API usage

If you're using a language not yet supported by an official SDK, you can still interact with the Agent API directly using HTTP requests over the Unix socket at `/run/miru/miru.sock`. 

You can find the complete reference of all available API endpoints in the Agent API Reference.
