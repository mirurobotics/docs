The Server-Side API uses **date-based versioning** with a train name. Each version follows the format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD.<train>
```

- The **date** is the version's publish date
- The **train** is a codename representing a major release epoch (e.g. `zion`)

All changes within a train are backward-compatible. A new train introduces a new epoch that may include breaking changes.

## Version header

The Server-Side API **requires** the `Miru-Version` header to be set to the version you want to use. 

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.mirurobotics.com/v1/devices' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  --header 'Miru-Version: 2025-10-21.zion'
```

Omitting the `Miru-Version` header will return a `400 Bad Request` error.

## Supported versions

Below is a list of the currently supported versions:

| API Version              |        Status       |
|--------------------------|---------------------|

## Support policy

Miru provides three levels of support for the Server-Side API

- Supported
- Deprecated
- End of life

When a new API version epoch is released (e.g. `zion` to `yellowstone`), previous API epochs may enter a deprecation period. During this period:

- The deprecated version continues to function normally
- No new features will be added to the deprecated epoch

Once the deprecation period ends, the API epoch is considered **end-of-life** and is no longer supported. Requests to an end-of-life epoch will return a `400 Bad Request` error.

## Deprecation notice

Since the Miru Server-Side API is still in beta, a fixed support schedule for beta releases is not established. 

Nonetheless, we are committed to ensuring that all users are migrated to a supported version before sunsetting an API version. Reasonable notice will be provided before deprecating and sunsetting any API versions.

## Stability guarantees

Within a train (e.g. `zion`), all changes are **additive and backward-compatible**. You can rely on the API contract remaining stable for the lifetime of a train.

When a new train is introduced, it may include breaking changes. Migration guides will be published to help you transition.
