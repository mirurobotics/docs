Miru provides SDKs to simplify interaction with the Server-Side API.

These SDKs handle the complexities of HTTP communication and API key authentication and provide type-safe interfaces for all available endpoints.

## Python

The Python [Server-Side SDK](https://github.com/mirurobotics/python-server-sdk) provides convenient access to the Server-Side API from any Python 3.8+ application. The SDK offers the following features:

- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and Pydantic models
- **Async Support**: Both synchronous and asynchronous clients
- **Automatic Retries**: Built-in retry logic for transient failures

For detailed documentation, examples, and advanced usage, visit the Python Server-Side SDK [repository](https://github.com/mirurobotics/python-server-sdk).

## Direct API usage

If you're using a language not yet supported by an official SDK, you can still interact with the Server-Side API directly using HTTP requests. See the [Server-Side API Reference](/docs/references/server-side-api) page for information about the available endpoints.
