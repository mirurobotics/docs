Miru supports continuous integration (CI) to automate various tasks, such as the creation of [releases](/docs/learn/releases/create) and their associated schemas.

CI pipelines leverage the [Miru CLI](/docs/developers/cli/overview) to programmatically execute any CLI commands, which accept an API key for authentication. 

Since the Miru CLI is the engine behind CI tasks, any tasks supported by the CLI can easily be automated in your CI pipeline.

## Supported CI tools

## API key authentication

When used in your CI pipeline, the CLI can be authenticated using an API key. Simply export the `MIRU_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export MIRU_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

To create an API key for your CI pipeline, follow the instructions in the [API keys](/docs/admin/apikeys#create-an-api-key) section.

## API key scopes

To determine the scopes to give an API key, find the CLI command you want to execute in the [CLI Reference](/docs/references/cli/release-create) and consult its **API key scopes** section.

For example, if you want to execute the `miru release create` command in CI, visit the create release command's [API key scopes](/docs/references/cli/release-create#api-key-scopes) section.
