Miru's Platform API is a REST API for programmatically managing your Miru resources.  The Platform API is primarily for backend and cloud-native applications, enabling you to build custom workflows for device provisioning, CI/CD pipelines, and more.

The Platform API is distinct from the Agent API, which is a REST API exposed by the Miru Agent for programmatic control by applications _running on your devices_.

While the Platform API is accessed over the internet, the [Agent API](/docs/developers/agent-api/overview) is available only on devices running the Miru Agent and does not require internet access to operate.
