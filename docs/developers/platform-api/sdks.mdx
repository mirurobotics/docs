Miru provides SDKs to simplify interaction with the Platform API.

These SDKs handle the complexities of HTTP communication and API key authentication and provide type-safe interfaces for all available endpoints.

## Python

The Python [Platform SDK](https://github.com/mirurobotics/python-server-sdk) provides convenient access to the Platform API from any Python 3.8+ application. The SDK offers the following features:

- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and Pydantic models
- **Async Support**: Both synchronous and asynchronous clients
- **Automatic Retries**: Built-in retry logic for transient failures

For detailed documentation, examples, and advanced usage, visit the Python Platform SDK [repository](https://github.com/mirurobotics/python-server-sdk).

## Direct API usage

If you're using a language not yet supported by an official SDK, you can still interact with the Platform API directly using HTTP requests. See the [Platform API Reference](/docs/references/platform-api) page for information about the available endpoints.
