title: "Pagination"
---

API resources support bulk fetching through list endpoints. For example, you can [**list config instances**](/docs/references/platform-api/latest/endpoints/config-instances/list) in a workspace. At a minimum, all list endpoints accept the **`limit`** and **`offset`** query parameters.

The Miru API paginates results to efficiently manage large datasets, returning a subset of items along with metadata to help you retrieve additional pages.

Currently, the Miru API uses [offset-based pagination](https://www.merge.dev/blog/offset-pagination), with support for [cursor-based pagination](https://www.merge.dev/blog/cursor-pagination) coming soon.

## Query parameters

All list endpoints optionally accept the **`limit`** and **`offset`** query parameters.

### Limit

`limit` specifies the maximum number of items that can be returned in a single request.

**The default is 10 while the maximum is 100.**

### Offset

`offset` specifies the starting position of the current page.

**The default is 0.**

### Example

A limit of 10 with an offset of 0 returns items 1-10. A limit of 15 with an offset of 10 returns items 11-25.

To specify the limit and offset, add the `limit` and `offset` query parameters to the list endpoint URL.

The following request specifies a limit of 10 and an offset of 0 by appending `?limit=10&offset=0` to the list endpoint URL.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.mirurobotics.com/v1/config_instances?limit=10&offset=0' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

## List response format

Every list response follows the same structure.

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "total_count": -1,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0,
  "has_more": false,
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "config_instance",
      "id": "cfg_inst_123",
      ...
    },
    {
      "object": "config_instance",
      "id": "cfg_inst_456",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Object

`object` is always a string with the value "list" to indicate that it is a list response.

**Total Count**

`total_count` is the total number of items matching the query. By default, the total count is not computed (and thus set to `-1`) to avoid the performance cost of counting all items.

To get the total count, you must explicitly request it using the `expand[]=total_count` parameter. While useful, the total count is typically not needed and can incur significant performance costs, so please use it judiciously. See the `total_count` [expansion](/docs/developers/platform-api/query-params/expansions#total-count) documentation for more information about retrieving the total count.

### Limit

`limit` specifies the number of items returned in the response.

If a valid value is provided (e.g., `10`), the response will reflect that value.

If an invalid value is provided (e.g., `1001`), the closest valid value will be used instead (in this case, `100`).

### Offset

`offset` indicates the starting index of the returned items.

If a valid value is provided (e.g., `5`), the response will reflect that value.

If an invalid value is provided (e.g., `-3`), the closest valid value will be used instead (`0` in this case).

### Has more

`has_more` is a boolean that indicates whether more items exist beyond the current page.

If `true`, you can fetch the next page by increasing the `offset` by the `limit`.

### Data

`data` is an array of the actual items returned by the query.

The number of items in the array will be less than or equal to the specified `limit`.

## Pagination walkthrough

To paginate a request, continually request the next page until `has_more` is `false`. The next page uses the same `limit` but the `offset` is increased by the `limit`.

First, let's request with a limit of 10 and an offset of 0.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.mirurobotics.com/v1/config_instances?limit=10&offset=0' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "total_count": -1,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0,
  "has_more": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "config_instance",
      "id": "cfg_inst_123",
      ...
    },
    {
      "object": "config_instance",
      "id": "cfg_inst_456",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

If `has_more` is `false`, there are no more items after the current page. If `has_more` is `true`, more items exist beyond the current page. The subsequent pagination request uses the same `limit` , but the `offset` is increased by the `limit`: `offset = offset + limit`.

This gives us an offset of 10 and a limit of 10. Repeat this process until `has_more` is `false`. The following request would use an offset of 20 and a limit of 10, then 30 and 10, and so on.
