title: "Authentication"

The Miru Platform API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Miru Dashboard](https://app.mirurobotics.com/secrets/api-keys).

For more information on creating and managing API keys, see the [API keys](/docs/admin/apikeys) section of the documentation.

To authenticate requests to the Miru Platform API, include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of your request:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.mirurobotics.com/v1/devices' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

All requests must be made over HTTPS. Any requests over plain HTTP or without authentication will fail.
