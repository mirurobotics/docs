<Update label="February 25, 2026">
    ## Config Editor v3.0

    We've rebuilt the config editor with four major new capabilities: edit and
    deploy multiple config files simultaneously, navigate diffs quickly,
    restore previous deployments instantly, and compare any two snapshots
    from a device's history.

    ### Multi-File Editing

    The editor now supports editing multiple files under a single deployment with 
    improved visibility and control:
    
    - **Persistent edits:** Switch between files or view historical deployments 
    without losing changes in your draft.
    - **Tab indicators:** Tabs display file status (`M` for modified, `A` for added) 
    and show linting error counts at a glance.
    - **Live change list:** The right panel provides a real-time summary of edits 
    across all files as you work.
    - **Deploy summary:** Review a file-by-file count of changes by type 
    (added, modified, deleted) before deploying.

        src="https://assets.mirurobotics.com/docs/changelog/26-02-25/multi-file-editing.mp4"
    />

    ### Redeploy

    Restore any previous deployment directly from the editor. Simply right-click 
    any deployment in the History tab and select **Redeploy** from the menu to open 
    the dialog. 
    
    All configuration from the historical deployment is perfectly preserved and 
    shipped as a brand-new deployment on the device.

        src="https://assets.mirurobotics.com/docs/changelog/26-02-25/redeploy.mp4"
    />

    ### Diff Navigation

    A floating navigation card now appears at the bottom of the editor when viewing 
    diffs, allowing you to quickly navigate changes both within and across files. 
    
    - **Auto-scroll to first diff:** The editor automatically jumps to the first 
    difference so you never have to scroll manually.
    - **In-file navigation:** Use the up and down buttons to jump line-by-line 
    between changes within the current file. 
    - **Cross-file navigation:** File navigation buttons let you quickly skip 
    between files. It only cycles through files that actually have changes, 
    bypassing untouched files.
    - **Change overview list:** Click the change counter label (e.g., `1 of 13`) to 
    open a dropdown listing every change in the current file, including its 
    modification type and path. Click any item to jump instantly to that line.

        innerRadius="0 0 0 8px"
    />

    ### Snapshot Comparison

    Compare any two deployments directly from a device's history. Before, you could 
    only see the diff between a deployment and its parent. Now, you can swap out the 
    base deployment, making it easy to compare changes across any two points in time.

        <DropdownItem>
            **JSON Semantic Diffs:** Diffs are now powered by JSON semantics rather 
            than plain text, making it much clearer to see exactly what configuration 
            values changed instead of just what lines changed.
        </DropdownItem>
        <DropdownItem>
            **Draft / History Tab Split:** The right panel now has dedicated
            Draft and History tabs. The editor opens to the draft tab by default with
            files automatically created from the most recent deployment.
        </DropdownItem>

            **External Deployment Alert:** If another user deploys to the same
            device while your draft is open, an alert appears. You can discard
            your changes, keep them (rebasing onto the new deployment), or
            acknowledge and continue editing.

            **Changes Lost When Switching Configs:** Switching to a historical deployment

    ## Create Releases in CI/CD

    You can now create releases directly from your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring releases are up to date and created consistently.

    Furthermore, creating a release has been streamlined: only a single CLI command is required and CUE packages now support defining schemas across multiple files.

    ### GitHub Actions workflow

    We've released an official GitHub Actions workflow for creating releases in CI/CD. The workflow installs the Miru CLI and accepts an API Key for authentication, letting you execute any CLI commands from your GitHub runner.

    ### Create release CLI command
    
    The new `miru release create` command bundles the entire release process. It creates the release, pushes its schemas, and captures associated Git metadata in one step for greater reliability and ease of use.

    ### CUE packages

    The CLI now supports CUE packages, allowing you to define schemas across multiple files while treating them as a single logical schema in Miru.

    ## Workspace Logo

    You can now personalize your workspace with a team logo and add a profile picture 
    to your account. We’ve also added a new feedback form in the app so you can easily 
    share your thoughts or report bugs.

    ### Upload a workspace logo

    Admins and owners can now upload a custom logo for their workspace. Once set, the 
    logo is displayed in the sidebar and invite pages, giving new members a branded 
    welcome experience.

    ## CUE Support

    We are excited to announce full support for CUE (Configure, Unify, Execute) 
    as a first-class schema language in Miru. You can now define config schemas in 
    CUE, version them in Git, and push them via the Miru CLI to validate config 
    instances before deployment.

    ### Uploading a CUE schema

    Pushing a CUE schema to Miru follows the same Git-integrated workflow you are used 
    to. Simply define your schema in a `.cue` file and use the Miru CLI to push it.

    />

    ### Managing CUE schemas

    Once uploaded, your CUE schemas appear in the dashboard where you can view the raw 
    content (preserving comments and formatting) and associated metadata.

    Management works just like existing schemas: most properties are immutable, though 
    you can update the config instance deployment path. Deletion is only permitted 
    for schemas with no active config instances.

    ### Inviting team members

    Onboard your team directly from the dashboard. Navigate to **Settings > Members** 
    and click the **Invite** button.

    Once you enter their email and select a role, they will receive an email with 
    a link to join your workspace.

    - **New users** will be guided to sign up and then prompted to accept the invitation.
    - **Existing users** can accept the invite via the email link or their Profile settings 
    page.

    - **Owner** — Full control over the workspace (limit one per workspace).
    - **Admin** — Administrative access to manage members and workspace settings.
    - **Member** — Application access without administrative privileges.

    Admins and owners can manage members: update roles, edit names, suspend users, 
    resend or revoke invites, and reinvite suspended/left users.

    accessing the config editor. This two-step process requires:
    
    1. **Select a release** - Choose which software version this device will run
    2. **Deploy configurations** - Create a new deployment or deploy a staged deployment
