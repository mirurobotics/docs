## v0.9.1 

*February 4, 2026*

### Fixes

- Error messages are properly flushed to the console, ensuring outputs are always visible in CI

---

## v0.9.0

*January 27, 2026*

`v0.9.0` is a major release replacing the schema-push workflow with a single `miru release create` command that handles releases, schemas, and Git metadata in one step. Also adds API key authentication for CI/CD use.

### `miru release create`

The `miru schema push` command has been replaced by [miru release create](/docs/references/cli/release-create), which bundles the entire release process into a single command. [CUE packages](/docs/references/cli/release-create#cue-packages) are now supported, allowing schemas to span multiple files.

```bash
miru release create --version v1.0.0 schema.json
```

### API key authentication

The CLI now supports authentication via API keys using the `MIRU_API_KEY` environment variable, enabling non-interactive use in CI/CD pipelines.

Visit the [CI/CD guide](/docs/developers/ci/overview) for more information on using the CLI in CI/CD pipelines.

### Improvements

- Improved error messages to be more descriptive and readable

### Retired

- Retired the `miru schema push` command

---

## v0.8.0

*December 18, 2025*

`v0.8.0` is a cleanup release removing deprecated flags from `miru schema push` ahead of the v0.9.0 command replacement.

### Breaking changes

**Schema push command**

```diff
miru schema push schema.json \
-   --version v1.0.0 \
-   --allow-duplicate
```

- Removed the `--version` flag
- Removed the `--allow-duplicate` flag

---

## v0.7.0

*December 4, 2025*

`v0.7.0` introduces first-class CUE support and updates the schema push workflow to support multiple schema languages.

### CUE support

`v0.7.0` is the first CLI release with [CUE](/docs/learn/schemas/languages/overview) support. You can now push CUE-based schemas directly and use CUE alongside existing JSON Schema workflows.

### Schema push improvements

- Added the `--language` flag to `miru schema push` to specify schema language
- Added the `--allow-duplicate` flag to `miru schema push` to allow multiple schemas with the same content
- Schemas uploaded to Miru are now preserved exactly as defined, including original ordering, spacing, and comments

### Other improvements

- Improved readability of error messages
- Users are notified when the CLI version is out of date

### Breaking changes

**Version flag**

The `--version` flag is now required when pushing a schema, and JSON Schema annotations were renamed:

```diff
- "$miru_config_type_slug": "my-config"
- "$miru_instance_filepath": "/etc/myapp/config.json"
+ "x-miru-config-type": "my-config"
+ "x-miru-instance-filepath": "/etc/myapp/config.json"
```

**Instance file path**

- Removed the ability to update the instance file path for an existing schema

### Retired

- Removed the `miru instance to jsonschema` command
