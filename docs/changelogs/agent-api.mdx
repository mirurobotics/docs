## v0.2.0

*TBD*

The `v0.2.0` release expands the Agent API from basic device health/version endpoints to deployment-pipeline visibility. 

The current release version endpoint is the most exciting, enabling on-device applications to ensure that the release version of the config instances matches the application's software version.

### New endpoints

Added read-only endpoints for inspecting deployment pipeline state from on-device applications.

**Deployments**
- `GET /deployments/current` — get the currently deployed deployment
- `GET /deployments/{deployment_id}` — get a deployment by ID

**Releases**
- `GET /releases/current` — get the currently deployed release
- `GET /releases/{release_id}` — get a release by ID

**Git commits**
- `GET /git_commits/{git_commit_id}` — get a git commit by ID

### Breaking changes

**Base path change**

The URL version prefix changed from `/v1` to `/v0.2`. Update all request URLs in your client application.

```diff
- http://localhost/v1/{endpoint}
+ http://localhost/v0.2/{endpoint}
```

**Extended version response**

The `GET /version` response renamed `commit` to `git_commit` and added new fields:

```diff
 {
   "version": "0.7.0",
-  "commit": "abc1234"
+  "git_commit": "abc1234",
+  "api_version": "0.2.0",
+  "api_git_commit": "def5678",
+  "rust_version": "1.83.0",
+  "build_date": "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z",
+  "os": "linux",
+  "arch": "aarch64"
 }
```

### Migration steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify agent compatibility">
    Ensure all devices in your fleet are running **Miru Agent v0.7.0** or later. See the [agent compatibility matrix](/docs/developers/agent-api/versioning#agent-compatibility-matrix) for details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update base path">
    Update all request URLs from `/v1` to `/v0.2`

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash v0.1.0
    curl --unix-socket /run/miru/miru.sock \
       --request GET \
      --url http://localhost/v1/device
    ```

    ```bash v0.2.0
    curl --unix-socket /run/miru/miru.sock \
       --request GET \
      --url http://localhost/v0.2/device
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rename commit field">
    Rename the `GET /version` response field `commit` to `git_commit`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optionally integrate new endpoints">
    Integrate with the new deployments, releases, and git commits endpoints to inspect the deployment pipeline from your device.
  </Step>
</Steps>
