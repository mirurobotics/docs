API keys allow you to authenticate to the Miru [Platform API](/docs/developers/platform-api) as well as the Miru CLI in your [CI pipeline](/docs/developers/ci/overview).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

## Create an API key

import {ADMIN_TOOLTIP} from '/snippets/components/users/roles.jsx';

<Warning>
    You must be an <Tooltip tip={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.href}>admin</Tooltip> user to create an API key.
</Warning>

To create an API key, navigate to the [API Keys page](https://app.mirurobotics.com/secrets/api-keys) in the dashboard and click **New API Key** in the top right corner.

Provide a name for the API key, select the desired scopes, then click **Create**.

Once an API key has been created, it can never be retrieved again. If you lose your API key, you must create a new one.

## Delete an API key

Deleting an API key immediately revokes it. Attempting to authenticate with a deleted API key will fail.

Furthermore, deleting an API key is irreversible. Once an API key is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

To delete an API key, click the ellipsis (...) on the API key you want to delete and select **Delete**.
